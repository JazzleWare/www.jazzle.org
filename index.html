        <p id="first">Jazzle is a new parser for all versions of ECMAScript, itself written in ECMAScript.</p>
        <p>It obsessively strives to be fully compatible with the ECMAScript specification, and yet,
        it meets (and in nearly all benchmarks, beats) many other similar parsers currently in production.</p>
        <p>Its high speed, combined with its ability to catch the errors that won't get caught otherwise,
        makes it an excellent choice for integration with linters, IDE's, and a myriad of other ECMAScript code
        assessment tools. On an average 2012 laptop, </p>
    
        <p>
        Try below so you know it,
        stress-test so you trust it,
        check the benchmarks and get hibbie-jibbies,
        and make it more awesome than it already is!

   made with swearing, tears, kicking, and cries, (but no alcohol or drugs) by Neni and Ulolo.
   The authors then became disillusioned with that language, and converted to lua.
   Fortunately, all the toll this project took on them is so small as to become negligible after a year or two of extensive psychotherapy.
